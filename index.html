          Hello! My name is Pietro Pecora. I'm from New York and am currently studying at Boston University. This site outlines a couple of the things I did at iXperience while studying Web Development and Product Management. iXperience is a industry oriented program that teaches students relevant skills that industry professionals believe the industry is lacking. A novel approach at education, it armed my team with the skills to ideate and create a application based product-- Holy Cow. Following the 8 week of classes, I interned with Lightswitch Solutions, a social impact eLearning and eCommerce company. 
        </p> 
        <p>
          Outside of the educational sphere, I'm a runner and avid bookworm. I'm a brother of Alpha Kappa Psi, a professional business fraternity and obsessed with all things tech. I'm constantly attempting to reinvent myself and become a well-rounded individual. Some of my biggest inspirations include Christopher Hitchens, Amy Cuddy, and Elon Musk. 
          <br><br> Want to get in contact with me? I'm always looking for expand my network and connect with people who love reading or all things tech.

          With three other Product Management students, I tackled the environmental issues problem space. In collaboration with User Experience Design, we conducted market research and came up with two main conclusions: people feel that their individual impact to the big issue is negligible and it is inconvenient and unhabitual to be environmentally conscientious. Through more research, we saw that the agricultural industry and meat production industry contributes to 1/3 of the world's CO2 production.
        </p>
        <p>
          We ideated an environmental sustainability app, focusing on reducing one's environmental impact through their personal diet. Using 4 main features, we would create a community of users that would be more informed about their personal dietary impact by providing a service that conveniently lets users decide on which days to reduce their meat consumption. Starting small with "Meatless Mondays" can encourage users to adopt this habit, overall reducing his/her personal impact.
